# MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum
This repository contains a Language Identification project to classify descriptions of museum works and artifacts in their reference language. The model uses TF-IDF and Multinomial Naive Bayes to distinguish between Italian (it), English (en), and German (de).
